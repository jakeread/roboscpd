// ROBOT
/*
TBD
make it: config constructor, with meshes, joints that can be up-dated
consider internal architecture (within roboscpd):
	this is the VirtualRobot in the MTM 'VirtualMachine' sense, i.e. it holds what
	we hope is a local copy of the physical thing we are controlling, for display purposes 
	mostly
		-> this is NOT the robotSimulator, which will be a hermetic javascript set that we can use to
		prototype our control & physics algorithms
